= Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its voter base. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @workers: The urban working class, who typically prefer us to the opposition parties.
- @new_middle: The middle class, white-collar workers.
- @old_middle: The upper class, who usually vote for the PFJP.
- @rural: Rural workers and farmers.
- @unemployed: The Bluds, who have been against us since the Izzam Incident.
- @catholics: Religious Dastnurists.
- @root: We either don't want to or cannot campaign right now.
- @easy_discard

We have increased our campaigning among the workers. [? if unemployed >= 15: The high levels of unemployment make our campaign more difficult. ?][? if wtb_adopted = 1 : Adopting the WTB plan gives us a new rallying point around which to attract workers. ?]

We have increased our campaigning among the middle class. [? if socialism <= 49 and peoples_party == 0: The popular antipathy towards socialism among this group makes our campaign more difficult. ?] [? if peoples_party > 0: As a people's party, we have an easier time increasing support among the middle class than before. ?]

We have increased our campaigning among the upper class. [? if nationalism >= 51 and peoples_party == 0: The high levels of nationalism among this group make our campaign more difficult. ?] [? if peoples_party > 0: As a people's party, we have an easier time increasing support among the middle class than before. ?]

We have increased our campaigning among farmers. [? if peoples_party == 0: We have not historically campaigned much among the farmers, and they do not trust us. ?][? if peoples_party > 0: As a people's party, we have an easier time increasing support among farmers than before. ?][? if rural_policy >= 2 : Our rural policies have made it easier for us to build support among farmers. ?]
